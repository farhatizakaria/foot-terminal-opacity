# foot-terminal-opacity
This repository contains a minimalist and transparent theme configuration for the Foot terminal emulator, designed for Wayland environments like Sway and Hyprland.

## 🔍 What this config does
📁 [colors] section:
alpha=0.9: Your terminal background is 90% opaque, giving you 10% transparency — looks great over a wallpaper!

foreground=ffffff: White text

background=000000: Black background

## 🎨 Color Palette:
This sets your 16-color palette:

regularX → normal text colors

brightX → bright text colors (bold or emphasized)

This config gives a classic GNOME Terminal look, based on the Tango color scheme. It’s easy on the eyes and works well with both light and dark themes.
